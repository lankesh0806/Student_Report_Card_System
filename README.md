# Student_Report_Card_System
Description :-
Built a console-based Student Report Card Management System using Java that enables admin users to manage student records efficiently. The system allows adding student details with subject-wise marks, viewing all records, and searching or deleting data based on roll number or student name. The program automatically calculates the total marks, average, and grade based on the input, following a predefined grading system. Data is persistently stored using file serialization, ensuring that records remain intact between sessions. An admin login authentication mechanism enhances system security.
